# MealPicker!
This program is called MealPicker and it’s idea is to choose random meal for you, if you have one of those days when you are out of ideas what to eat. It’s possible to choose between the meal type (breakfast, lunch, dinner) and between season (winter, spring, summer, autumn). 

This program has two main features:
MealPicker, which basically choose a random meal according to users input about daytime and season. User can make a meal according to his preferences. E.g. user gets “Pasta” for lunch in autumn. So user can make a pasta of his choice, e.g., bolognese or carbonara, etc.
RecipePickers idea is the same, but user can add recipes himself. These are more complex dishes and user can store his favourites in RecipePicker and let the program choose randomly what do cook.
